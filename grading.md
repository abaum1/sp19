title: "Grading"
---

There will tentatively be 3 challenging projects and 8 homework assignments. Assignments must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer questions. Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, but all test cases will be public. Your two lowest labs and homeworks will be dropped.

- 20% Homeworks
- 10% Labs
- 5% Vitamins
- 15% Projects
- 20% Midterms (10% each)
- 30% Final

Midterm 1 will be in class on February 28th. Midterm 2 will be in class on
April 11th. The final exam will be May 16th from 11:30am - 2:30pm. If you miss a midterm for a pre-approved reason, such as a class conflict or illness, then you won’t make it up, but instead your other midterm and the final exam will be
used to compute your overall exam score (out of 50%).

### Graduate Version

Students enrolled in the undergraduate version of the course may opt for
the graduate grading scheme, which involves a final project instead of
labs and vitamins.

- 20% Homeworks
- 15% Projects
- 15% Final Project
- 20% Midterms (10% each)
- 30% Final

### On Time Policy (try not to be late)

No late homeworks, labs, or vitamins will be accepted unless an extension is
granted by a staff member. Late projects will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number of days. No project will be accepted
more than 5 days late.

### Collaboration Policy (don't cheat)

Data science is a collaborative activity.
While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually.
If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook.
Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final.
We will be following the [EECS
departmental policy on Academic
Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-dishonesty), so
be sure you are familiar with it.
